      <p>Hi!</p>
      <p>My name is Kaitlyn Ellis, a computer science student at the illustrious Howard University, slated for graduation in December 2024. Born and raised in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, I have always had a love and interest in technology, ever since watching the show "A Different World" at a young age, shoutout Dwayne!</p>
      <p>As far as my other interests, I enjoy watching movies, listening to various genres of music, and watching sports!</p>
      <p>I am interested in software engineering/development, game development/design, and web development roles, so feel free to look at my resume and contact me!</p>
